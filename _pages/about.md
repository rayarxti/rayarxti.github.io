I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Duke University in. I double major in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning and Statistical Science with a concentration in Data Science. I am also pursuing a minor in Linguistics. I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Monica Agrawal](https://www.monicaagrawal.com/) on application of LLM in healthcare, Prof. [Danyang Zhuo](https://danyangzhuo.com/) and [Anru Zhang](https://anruzhang.github.io/) on LLMs for healthcare data analysis, and Prof. Yunchuan Chen on sociopragmatics.

My interest lies in machine learning for healthcare, linguistics and cognitive science. In my free time, I enjoy cooking and playing tennis.
