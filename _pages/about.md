I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Duke University in. I double major in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning and Statistical Science with a concentration in Data Science. I am also pursuing a minor in Linguistics.

My interests lie within the application of AI and machine learning to aid scientific discovery and decision making, especially in the intersection with medicine. In my free time, I enjoy cooking cuisines with diverse cultural origins, and playing tennis.
