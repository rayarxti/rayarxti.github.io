I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning and Statistical Science with a concentration in Data Science at Duke University and minoring in Linguistics.

My interests lie within the application of AI and machine learning to aid scientific discovery and decision making.
