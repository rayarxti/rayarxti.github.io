# Software Development

**Automatic Medical Database (AutoDB)**, Duke Department of Computer Science

*Skills: Python (SQLite, DuckDB, Langchain & OpenAI API), Google BigQuery, Javascript (React, Observable Plot)*

- Created an end-to-end AI application to facilitate electronic health records data analytics for healthcare researchers.
- Utilized OpenAI GPT-4 API to translate natural language prompts to SQL and visualization code, and boost model performance to 419% by implementing state-of-the-art few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting methods.
- Designed and developed GUI with JavaScript React, and Observable Plot libraries.
- Presented results in the Duke CS+ summer research program assembly meeting and poster session (Jul. 2024); Tested on the Duke Medical School Datathlon and received unanimous positive feedback. (Apr. 2025)


**PyPI IEEG package**, Cogan Lab

*Skills: Python, C, Cython; YAML*

- Revamped intracranial electroencephalography data processing pipelines from Python to C to enhance efficiency.
- Led the packaging and publishing of the pipelines as the [IEEG](https://pypi.org/project/ieeg/) package on PyPI.


**RAvolution**, COMPSCI 316: Intro to Database Systems @ Duke

*Skills: PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM), Javascript (React, Next.js), HTML/CSS*

- Built a database-backed web application designed for Duke’s Housing & Resdiential Life office, offering modules for account management, activity organization, safety reporting, scheduling, and more.
- Implemented the user account module, with functionalities of registering accounts with role differentiation (resident, RA, RC), as well as searching user profiles with keyword filters.
